# Python Projects and Study Journey

This repository documents my journey in learning Python, following the official Python 3.13.0 documentation. Each project reflects the topics studied, emphasizing practical implementation of concepts and skills learned.

## **Projects Practiced**

### **2. Library Simulator**

-   **Description**: A system for managing a library's books and members, handling borrowing and returning of books.
-   **Focus Topics**:
    -   OOP concepts: classes, inheritance, and instance methods
    -   Exception handling: custom exceptions for book availability and loan limits
    -   Namespaces and encapsulation within classes

### **3. Backup System**

-   **Description**: A file backup and compression script with detailed logging and performance reporting.
-   **Focus Topics**:
    -   File system manipulation using `os` and `glob`
    -   Compression using `zipfile`
    -   Logging and error handling for robust operations
